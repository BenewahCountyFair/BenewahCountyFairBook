### Fair Mission

**Showing Our Best**
An educational display of skills, to provide a setting for new and
recommended methods, materials, varieties and high quality livestock. Judged (evaluated)
by personnel trained in methods, skills, best species, etc. Premiums paid to help defray
expense of exhibiting and to enhance spirit of competition so that the best produce, animals

exhibited. Community spirit and county pride developed through working together on a
constructive community project.

organizations, community leaders, 4-H Clubs, local businesses, the Fair Board, Junior Show
& Sale Committee, and the Junior Rodeo Committee.

**Class 8 - Market Baskets**

Each exhibit must include at least seven different fruits, vegetables, flowers, or herbs, with a minimum of four vegetables. Exhibitors must provide their own basket or container, which must fully contain the entire exhibit—no part of the entry may overflow onto the display table.

All horticultural items must be grown by the exhibitor, and no polish or artificial enhancers may be used on any item. Judging will follow the American System, with youth entries judged separately from adult entries.

No premiums will be awarded to exhibits that are not considered up to standard, regardless of the number of entries in the class.
