# Editor Guide

This guide helps volunteers update the Fairbook safely. Always work from a branch and confirm changes with the board before publishing.

## Editing on GitHub.com
1. Sign in to GitHub and open the file you need to update.
2. Click the pencil icon to edit.
3. Make your changes in Markdown. Use headings and lists to keep content easy to scan.
4. At the bottom of the page, create a new branch, summarize the change, and propose the edit.
5. Open a pull request and request board review.

## Editing with StackEdit
1. Visit [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) and create a new document.
2. Paste the current Markdown from GitHub into StackEdit.
3. Use the live preview to verify formatting with headings, tables, and buttons.
4. When finished, copy the Markdown back into the GitHub file editor.
5. Commit the changes on a branch and open a pull request for review.

!!! warning "Never Edit `main` Directly"
    All updates must go through a pull request. Direct pushes to `main` are disabled for non-admins and can break the published site.
