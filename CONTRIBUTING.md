# Contributing

Thank you for helping keep the Benewah County Fairbook accurate and welcoming. This repository powers the public website, so every change should be clear, reviewed, and approved.

## Workflow
1. Create a new branch for your update.
2. Edit the relevant `.md` file inside the `docs/` directory.
3. Open a pull request describing the changes.
4. Wait for the fair board to review and approve the update before merging.

You can make edits using the GitHub web editor or an external Markdown editor such as StackEdit. If you use StackEdit, copy the finished Markdown back into the GitHub file before creating your pull request.

A formal reviewer assignment policy will be added once multiple maintainers are active. Until then, tag a board member or administrator for approval on each pull request.
