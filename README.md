# Benewah County Fairbook

This repository powers the official Benewah County Fairbook website for the BenewahCountyFair organization. The site is built with MkDocs Material and published through GitHub Pages so exhibitors, volunteers, and visitors can access current fair information at any time.

## Live Site
The Fairbook is available at: <https://benewahcountyfair.github.io/fairbook/> (update once the site is live).

## Project Purpose
- Share the current fair schedule, rules, entry forms, and department guides online.
- Provide downloadable PDFs for quick printing and offline reference.
- Document governance and editing expectations for volunteers and board members.

## Contact

## Contributing
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [EDITOR_GUIDE.md](EDITOR_GUIDE.md) for workflows and editing tips. All changes require a pull request and board approval before merging into `main`.
