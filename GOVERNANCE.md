# Governance

This document outlines the decision-making policies for the Benewah County Fairbook repository.

## Repository Ownership
- GitHub Organization: `BenewahCountyFair`
- Primary repository branch: `main` (represents the live Fairbook site)

## Branching Policy
- Annual archives are stored in branches named `fairbook-YYYY` (for example, `fairbook-2025`).
- Feature and content updates must be created in short-lived branches and merged through pull requests.

## Merge Authority
- Only organization administrators may merge pull requests into `main`.
- Every rule change or structural update requires formal approval from the Benewah County Fair Board before merging.

## Content Rules
- Volunteers may update page text and approved assets but must not change the navigation structure or rename files without board approval.
- All documents should maintain clear, family-friendly language and reflect current board decisions.

Questions about these policies should be directed to the board chair or repository administrator.
