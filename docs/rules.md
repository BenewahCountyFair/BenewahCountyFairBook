## Fair Mission

**Showing Our Best**

An educational display of skills that provides a setting for new and recommended methods, materials, varieties, and high-quality livestock. Premiums are paid to help defray the expense of exhibiting and to enhance the spirit of competition so that the best produce, animals, and materials are showcased.

Community spirit and county pride are developed through working together on this constructive community project. The fair is organized by the people of Benewah County, mainly through the efforts of organizations, community leaders, 4-H Clubs, local businesses, the Fair Board, Junior Show & Sale Committee, and the Junior Rodeo Committee.
