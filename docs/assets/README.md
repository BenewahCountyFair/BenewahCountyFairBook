# Assets Folder

Store public-facing images and media here, such as fairground maps, sponsor logos, and downloadable graphics. Use descriptive yet stable filenamesâ€”changing a filename can break links embedded on the site or shared externally.

Recommended tips:

- Optimize images for the web to keep page loads fast.
- Prefer `.webp` or `.png` formats for clarity and compression.
- Document the source and usage rights for each asset in commit messages.
